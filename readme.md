# Blender Might and Magic UV addon

This is a collection of my scripts for blender, as well as UV addon for development of Might and Magic maps (if you are like me and need to instantly see results and test different textures in blender). Scripts except addon probably won't be useful for you, I put them here for extra backup and learning how to do basic stuff in blender scripts, if someone stumbles upon this repo.

The addon is file "mm uv operator.py". If you wish to use it, download the file and install it using blender addon manager. For now it has been tested only for blender 3.5 (3.2 worked too, but a bit in the past).
